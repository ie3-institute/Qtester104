# QTester_IEC104

This software implements the IEC60870-5-104 protocol (client side) for substation data acquisition and control via tcp/ip network using the QT UI Framework. The Software is compiles with QT 4.11.2 (Community).

This software implements an IEC 60870-5-104 protocol tester.
IEC 60870-5-104 is a commonly used protocol for data acquisition and control of power substations.

Directories:
Source_Code - multiplatform qt sources, compile with QT 5.13.1 or later on any supported platform.
GUI - win32 binaries built with QT 5.13.2.
Conf - configuration file

Can be used to poll substation data and issuing commands.
The base protocol classes are pure C++ without any platform or non-standard library dependencies, can be used to develop software with other compiler/library/sdk.
The software is part of a full substation HMI project (OSHMI - Open Substation HMI), it functions as a protocol module for the HMI, but can be used as a standalone protocol tester.

It's possible to send a General Interrogation ([GI] button) and log messages on the screen. 
At the right panel is shown a table with the following data columns:
Protocol [Address] | Last acquired [Value] | ASDU [Type] | [Cause] of transmission | Quality [Flags] | [Count] of transmissions.

**new implementation:**
1. Possibility to open more than one client in one instance. 
    This can be prepared on the one hand with the Conf file (just add RTU1, RTU2 ... sections to the ini file in the Conf Folder)
    or via the button (+ Add Client).This button enables the client name, port number and IP address of the new client to be entered.
    These are also automatically entered in the corresponding tab.
2. Welcome page in which all clients are entered. 
3. Forwarding to the client or tab by double-clicking on the row in the widget table. 
4. automatic connection with the specified IP address. 
5. Automatic point mapping.  
6. Closable tabs(Clients)
    

The protocol quality flags are:
on / off / tra (double point transition) / ind (double point indefinite) / bl (blocked) / iv (invalid) / nt (not topical) / sb (substituted) / ov (overflow) / t (reg.step transition).

An optional configuration file can be used to store basic parameters, in the form of a INI file (qtester104.ini):

[BDTR]
; 0 (default): Normal operation mode
; 1: Force to be primary when in redundant mode
; FORCE_PRIMARY=0

[IEC104] 
PRIMARY_ADDRESS=1        ; link address of the primary station (computer)

[RTU1]                   ; communicates with only one RTU in this version
Name = ...               ; Name of the Client 
SECONDARY_ADDRESS=2      ; protocol link address of the RTU
IP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.1   ; IP address of the RTU
; IP_ADDRESS_BACKUP=192.168.1.2   ; IP address of the BACKUP RTU
ALLOW_COMMANDS=1         ; 1=allow sending commands, 0=don't permit commands
; PORT=2404              ; Protocol port (default=2404)
; GI_PERIOD = 330        ; time period in seconds for general interrogations (default=330s)
